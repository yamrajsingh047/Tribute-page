        <h2> &rAarr; Early Life :-</h2>
        <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli,
            worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother,
            Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna. Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his
            early education at Vishal Bharti Public School. According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early
            affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl to
            him

            In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd
            espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for
            him to meet Rajkumar Sharma. Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered
            enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited
            more than just playing in gully cricket. Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to
            secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly
            received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he
            declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team. He received
            training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at
            Vasundhara Enclave. In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent
            School during his ninth-grade education.

            On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack. During his
            childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his
            father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's
            presence at times. According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's
            death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to
            the sport. Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they
            relocated to Gurgaon.</p>


        <h2> &rAarr; King Kohli :-</h2>

        <p>Virat Kohli (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international
            cricketer who plays Test and One Day International (ODI) cricket for the Indian national team. A former
            captain in all formats, Kohli retired from Twenty20 International (T20I) following India's win at the 2024
            T20 World Cup. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler. He
            represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Delhi in domestic cricket. He
            holds the record as the highest run-scorer in IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as the
            fourth-highest in international cricket. He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI
            cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli is widely regarded as
            one of the greatest batsmen of all time and the greatest batsman in the modern era.[citation needed] Kohli
            was a key member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20
            World Cup and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.

            In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of
            T20I rankings. In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the
            number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade.
            In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.</p>

            <h2>&rAarr; Career Life :-</h2>
            <dt>Comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar</dt><br>
            <dd>Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin
                Tendulkar, whom he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's
                "successor", he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the
                future.His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, whom he idolized in his formative years and
                sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of
                batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[24] Kohli's aggressive and
                dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has
                acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style. He has been lauded as the "new king of
                world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer. While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra
                has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots, Kohli's skills with the bat have earned
                him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the
                world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.</dd><br><br>

            <dt>Playing style</dt><br>
            <dd>Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing
                demeanour. His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly
                open-chested stance, and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his
                agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst
                thriving in high-pressure situations. In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing
                grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots
                and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.


                Kohli playing his famous flick shot at the 2015 Cricket World Cup
                Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature
                stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed
                towards leg stump. Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is
                characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep
                square leg and mid-on. Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his
                play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability
                to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to
                craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning. Kohli is also a proficient
                fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.

                However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump. Bowlers often
                exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.
                This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions. Cricket experts such
                as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness, and
                former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to
                out-swinging deliveries.

                Kohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batsman by
                cricketing experts and aficionados alike. In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when
                batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first. He has amassed 27 of his 50 ODI hundreds in
                run-chases, and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when batting second. In reference
                to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing,
                relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently manage strike
                rotation and execute boundary hits. His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication,
                concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.</dd>
